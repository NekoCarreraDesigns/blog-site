    <p class="intro">
      A phrase uttered by one of my co-workers at my stupid service industry
      job, or sSiJ as it will be known from here on out. This is my blog space
      where I will right about whatever I feel like writing about, their will
      also be a companion music blog, called Jamtron's Revenge, and last but not
      least, a link to my portfolio website of sites, and apps I've developed
    </p>

      The past few months have been by most peoples standards a train wreck, but
      by my standards a disaster of epic movie like proportions, 2021 started
      pretty mellow, I continued my job search for a web developer position.
      Getting regular income from my sSiJ, while hating every minute of my forty
      hour existence. I thought it was going pretty well. I stayed positive
      about being able to get my chance to use my new found developer skills
      when disaster struck. My faithful purple laptop of 5 years decided to call
      it quits one day while I was in the middle of a job application none the
      less. Then when I couldn't think things could possibly be worse, "You like
      never pay attention to us anymore, and we're over it" Jess said with the
      most serious look on her face, "even your dogs don't get to be around you,
      always on that laptop looking at code and writing code, code, code, what
      are you gonna do know without your precious laptop Nick?". Not only was my
      relationship over, my laptop was gone
